# GEN4-FT813-50CTP-CLB-4D-Systems_a_TMS320F28335

Working on my school project.

Microcontroller: TMS320F28335

Display: GEN4-FT813-50CTP-CLB 4D Systems

Programming studio: Code Composer v11

Status: Fully working

Connection between microcontroller and display is only 7 pins, wiew datasheet - https://4dsystems.com.au/mwdownloads/download/link/id/762/

power: pin 27 = 5v+;
pin 30 = GND;

and for SPI 4 pins:
pin 4 = SPI_CS;
pin 6 = SPI_MOSI;
pin 7 = SPI_MISO;
pin 8 = SPI_SCK;

LEGEND:
 4GEN-BOB pin = TMS pin
